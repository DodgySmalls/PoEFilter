# PoEFilter
While not literally a fork, some code adapted from Thiole (https://github.com/Thiole/LootFilter)

This is intended to be a visually lightweight filter, similar to the core PoE filter.
The only additional colours that have been added are red, for a few rare purposes, and pink for RBG and 6s items. Beyond that no new colours will be present on the screen, so hopefully we can all stay away from Path of Rainbow Particle Effect Explosion.

# Functionality

Displays currency similar to normal, upper currency is given a rich highlight, mirrors are obvious.

Displays all uniques as normal, their tags have a somewhat sacred feeling.

Borders given to 5/6L > 6s > RBG (red, pink, light pink respectively).

Displays all bases near the zone level, and all end game BiS bases (including some provisional 2.0.0 bases)

Displays support skillgems with a slight highlight, and all quality 10+ gems with a border.

Displays flasks near the zone level, and highlights utility flasks before end game.

ALL 'unwanted' items are then given a transparent background, NO LABELS ARE HIDDEN.


# Neglected options

Chisel recipe bases are NOT highlighted

Items are NOT displayed differently proportional to their absolute value (only relative to ilevel)
