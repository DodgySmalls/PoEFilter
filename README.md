# PoEFilter
This is intended to be a visually lightweight filter, similar to the core PoE filter.
The only additional colours that have been added are red, for a few rare purposes, and pink for RBG and 6s items. Beyond that no new colours will be present on the screen, so hopefully we can all stay away from Path of Rainbow Particle Effect Explosion.

# Functionality

Currency:
	Higher tiered currency is distinct, mid currency is displayed normally, scraps/fragments are smaller


# Neglected options

Chisel recipe bases are NOT highlighted

Items are NOT displayed differently proportional to their absolute value (only relative to ilevel)
